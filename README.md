## Map

The map [Country Streak fails](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/622435285ee8bf00018917be) was made using locations that ended my friends' NM country streak games. It has been filtered to keep only the locations played during No Moving rounds and from friends with over 75% success rate in no moving. Some locations deemed too easy have been manually removed from the map. 

If someone wants to have their country streak games logged, simply add me as a [friend](https://www.geoguessr.com/user/5ffe4fdd1e438a00011be16e).
